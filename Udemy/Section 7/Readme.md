# Section 7 - Arrays and Vectors
Everything to do with Arrays and Vectors in C++.

## Note:
I stopped declaring namespaces from [5_vectorChallenge.cpp](https://github.com/0xToast/Cplusplus/blob/main/Udemy/Section%207/5_vectorChallenge.cpp) onwards, to make my code a little more readable and make it clearer which libraries I am using, and to get into the habit of it to avoid namespace problems in future coding projects.
